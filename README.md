# hello-world

Once there was a king made of cheese. He was the cheese, but this was hard to grasp.
From time to time he would let his thoughts consume him; it wasn't rare to find him deep in thought,
starring beyond. You see, this is what had made him so effective running his kingdom (besides, who else was there to rule?), 
yet at the same time such a liability. 

Thoughts are scarce tonight. Words slip by. The king feels tired. Tomorrow will be another day.
